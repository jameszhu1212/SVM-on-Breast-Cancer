# SVM-on-Breast-Cancer

In this project, I implemented a support vector classifier to classify if the patient's breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign. Malignant means the breast cancer is spreading rapidly and is destorying nearby normal tissues. Benign means the breast cancer is growing, not spreading and is not a threat to the patient's survivial. Malignant is represented by 1 and benign is represented by 0.
